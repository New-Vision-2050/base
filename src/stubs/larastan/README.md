# Larastan stubs

Files in this directory are not typical Laravel stubs (i.e. files used as templates
for generating new models/controllers etc). They just happen to share the same name.

Larastan stubs are just like _ide_helper.php or _ide_helper_models.php files that we
can use to instruct Larastan, the static analysis tool we use, to understand more
about problematic files.
